# Calculator

This calculator was made with this tutorial: http://www.instructables.com/id/Creating-a-Calculator-Visual-Studio-C/ and experimented with after that.

It has two faults: The button that changes a positive number into a negative has little effect when calculating and I don't know why the cursor around the buttons keeps sticking to the last button.
